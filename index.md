# Visualizations of Marriage and Family Formation Data Within 2020 Decennial Census

Note: Maps and tables that show the percentage of householders aged 15-64 who are married show only those areas with at least 100 householders in that age range; similarly, maps that show the percentage of households with kids that are led by married couples show only those areas with at least 100 households with kids.

## Categorical Census tract maps

These maps group regions into four different categories: *Deserts*, *Lower share* areas, *Higher share* areas, and *Oases.* These categories, regardless of the region being displayed, are based on percentiles for *tracts* with a relevant population of at least *100*.
