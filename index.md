# Visualizations of Marriage and Family Formation Data Within 2020 Decennial Census for our 'Marriage Deserts' brief

Note: Maps and tables that show the percentage of householders aged 15-64 who are married include only those areas with at least 100 householders in that age range; similarly, maps that show the percentage of households with kids that are led by married couples include only those areas with at least 100 households with kids.

## Contiguous-desert maps and tables

### Largest contiguous marriage deserts

These maps and tables show the largest contiguous marriage deserts by number of householders aged 15-64. (For this analysis, a tract is considered a 'marriage desert' if (a) fewer than 27% of the householders aged 15-64 who live there are married and (b) it has at least 100 householders aged 15-64.)

To create these maps and tables, I first grouped desert tracts together, then determined which tracts had the highest number of householders aged 15-64. 

*(Note: the population values shown within these maps and tables represent the number of householders aged 15-64 rather than the total population.)*

### Largest contiguous married-family deserts

These analyses show the married-family deserts with the largest numbers of households with children. (For this analysis, a tract is considered a 'married-family desert' if (a) fewer than 44% of its households with kids are led by a married couple and (b) it has at least 100 households with children.

*(Note: the population values shown within these maps and tables represent the number of households with children rather than the total population.)*

## Categorical Census tract maps

These maps group regions into four different categories: *Deserts*, *Lower share* areas, *Higher share* areas, and *Oases.* These categories, regardless of the region being displayed, are based on percentiles for *tracts* with a relevant population of at least *100*.
